•	Analyzed 30,000 customer records over a 6-month period to identify patterns leading to credit card default; dataset included demographic, billing, and payment history attributes.
•	Conducted key EDA steps: Data cleaning (corrected invalid age values, handled negative bill amounts), Duplicate checks, Outlier Treatment, One Hot Encoding, Feature inspection (PAY_X, BILL_AMTX categorized properly), Scaling, Data Imputation.

•	Key insights: Younger customers (age <30) and those with frequent payment delays across multiple months (PAY_X features) showed higher default probability.
•	Discovered unbalanced class distribution in target variable (defaults vs non-defaults), critical for future model tuning.
•	Delivered a cleaned, structured dataset ready for predictive modeling to help financial institutions minimize credit risk exposure.
